Title: Forbidden Rhythms, Tempo 2(00 BPM)

Course: CGAD

Brief Overview:

Adding a little sidekick to the game with a new minigame to show off his ability's, he will help the player get across the rhythm levels much quicker and maybe even be a good human shield for potential new enemy's walking about. New difficulty system which allows you to place a checkpoint wherever you want when in easy mode, just the same when it is in normal and no checkpoints when it is hard. Fear not about the hard mode though as there will be new powerups such as invincibility for a brief period of time, making you move 2 blocks instead of 1, etc.. and even then if it is too hard after that then you might be able to find out the secret code to make the levels a whole lot easier.

The sidekick- will make the level faster when you are within a one block radius of him , he will not be affected by powerups and will only disappear once hard mode has been activated as not to make the game too easy. If i get around to the speed run mode he will also make you faster in that as well but you better be careful as to not make it completely impossible.

Must Have:

A sidekick who helps you out by speeding up the game if you are withing one block of him, WASD for the player arrows for the sidekick both need to make it to the end of the level to complete it.

A new surfer minigame with the sidekick where you dodge obstacles like sharks and breaking through objects like plastic waste, eg just an extension of the 2nd level

A new feature allows you to set one random checkpoint of your choosing during any of the movement levels.

Should Have: 

a difficulty range that if you set the new mode feature to easy during the level, easy being able to place a checkpoint anywhere, normal getting rid of any user place checkpoints and hard getting rid of checkpoints in general.

adding powerups in both types of minigames for example if you kick an object at the right time you will be given a speed boost or invincibility , or just a speed boost and invincibility throughout the walking levels

Could Have: 

More enemy's that walk across the board during the rhythm minigames such is random military men that shoot at both the player and sidekick trying to kill them (when sidekick is killed no reset and able to complete it without him)

Possible secret code that makes the player and sidekick invincible with funny edited text to go along with it, (basically a new mode of the game that is less serious)


Wish To Have: 

Leaderboards to track who has the best time and is completing the levels the fastest

Random events that happen during the games eg (shark attack , having to spam space to get away from its clutches)

a speed running mode that allows players to set the tempo of the game/music and play along with it to truly get the fastest time
